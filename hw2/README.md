# Homework 2

All the code was done by Tatiana Acero-Cuellar. I asked Miguel Pedraza some questions about the fit to a gaussian distribution, however we do not work together in this homework.



* what was this homework about? relate it to what we discussed in class
  Boltzman homework had the purpose of familiarize us with a physical example of some statistical distribution, in this case the chi distribution. Also familiarized with the mean.
   Central Limit Theorem had the purpose of familiarize us with different types of distributions and how to used it in python. Also evidence and illustrate the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers with 5 different distributions
   Both parts of the homework had the purpose of familiarized with python.
   The lecture had the purpose of present some controversies around the scheme of the p-value and the Null Hypothesis Rejection Testing
* what was the hardest part of the homework for you?
  The lecture.... I think is because it was written by someone outside the math, physical o statistical world...
* what was the easiest part of the homework for you?
  To code the plots
one new thing that you have learned
  I did not know about the law of large numbers and that is possible to illustrate the central limit theorem with the distribution of means.
